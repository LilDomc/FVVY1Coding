If you have stumbled across this repository let me give you a quick rundown on what this one is about:
- This rep is made for my college class, where we learn about coding and some cybersecurity basics
- The code will be basic unless instructed otherwise
- This is for us to learn on how to use Git and GitHub
- No, you will not find anything usefull here and will see some bad code but that is the price you pay for checking this rep out
